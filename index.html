        I'm Marlon Caisip, I've designed applications, and websites that are
        more simpler and easy to use, lessening the friction to the users. I
        have spent time learning about design principles and practicing my
        skills to design.

      <p class="infoContent">
        I started learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript a few years ago. However,
        designing for user experience has always been a passion of mine. I
        graduated from Soledad R. Villafuerte Elementary School, finished my
        Junior High School at CBSUA - Sipocot, and Senior High School at King
        Thomas Learning Academy Inc. I am currently taking a bachelor's degree
        in Information Technology at CBSUA Sipocot.

        <br />
        <br />

        My interest in programming and designing started when website
        development was introduced to us by our instructor, Tito Tabs. At that
        time, AI wasn't yet available, so going to the library, reading books,
        watching YouTube tutorials, reading guides, and docs were the key to
        developing my skills.

        <br />
        <br />

        After my pursuit of basic website development, I stumbled upon powerful
        programming languages like C#, C++, Java, and so on. However, Python was
        the one that caught my attention. The majority of the community agrees
        that it is the most efficient and friendly programming language to
        learn. So, I studied this language in pursuit of machine learning, to be
        specific, creating my own Jarvis as I was interested in Iron Man's AI
        assistant.

        <br />
        <br />

        Things turned out my way, I was having a hard time learning Python for a
        few reasons. I stopped for a while and then shifted to VFX effects,
        where Adobe products were first introduced to me.

        <br />
        <br />

        Not so long after, I had to take a break and focus on refining my skills
        as a musician. I studied the art of music, beginner to intermediate
        piano lessons, and music theory.

        <br />
        <br />

        After a long while, I got interested in operating systems. So, I went
        back and forth to using Windows and Linux. Personally, I have fun using
        Linux, in fact, using Linux made me considered Windows a trash OS. But
        the majority of my time, I use Windows, and it's great.

        <br />
        <br />

        It was a long journey for me but I learned so many skills through that,
        and right now, I'm learning Java, SQL, & Angular. I might study Python
        soon, and name my project JARVIS. The innovation are massive, so I'm
        trying to keep up, and this website is the proof of that.

    <div class="box">
      <div class="sectionTitle">What I do</div>
      <div class="horizontal-line"></div>
      <p class="infoContent">
        I make simple yet functional designs that make people's lives easier
        such as application, website, and product design. Too much visual
        clutter can be distracting, so I make it direct and honest through
        user-first design principles that is both visually appealing and easy to
        understand. Designing is an endless process of trying new approach that
        is beneficial to users experience, as well as finding out what's
        pleasing to eyes yet meaningful and useful, and solving problems that
        matters. User Experience Design will evolve far greater than it is now,
        and in the latter future the Interface Design, Product Design, and
        Service Design will change, and its important for developers to be able
        to catch up with these developments.

        <br />
        <br />

        I have some knowledge of Java and Python, and I am proficient in HTML,
        CSS, JavaScript, user experience design, user journey mapping, and UI/UX
        design.

      <p class="infoContent">
        I'm watching Anime, and I'm in Season 5 Episode 28 of Naruto. Weekly
        updates for Zom 100: Bucket List of the Dead, The Eminence in Shadow,
        Jujutsu Kaisen, Frieren: Beyond Journey's End, The Rising of the Shield
        Hero, Goblin Slayer, Shangri-La Frontier, Ragna Crimson, and etc. are
        taking long so I spent some time on reading Dr. Stone, That Time I Got
        Reincarnated as a Slime, Tales of de**ns and go*s, and Magic Emperor.
        You might wonder, where do I get all the time for these? Well, I have my
        ways.

        <br />
        <br />

        But seriously, I'm thinking about how can user-first design principles
        can be beneficial for the masses of people. How can these principles
        bring social change? Is glassmorphism the best UI? Or is it Neumorphism?
        Or maybe Minimalism? Or maybe the best approach is to use all of them in
        one design?

        <br />
        <br />

        What's more to design than design itself?
